/* desktop_midi.h - the desktop's MIDI sources, and the hub they feed.
 *
 * mtp_midi.h is a single stamped-byte FIFO, because that is what a UART is.
 * On a desktop the same FIFO can be fed from several places at once, and
 * deliberately is: the whole point of this build is that a person can drive the
 * same code from whatever they happen to own.
 *
 *   tty      a real 31250-baud serial line. The highest-fidelity source there
 *            is, because it is bit-for-bit what the T113's UART2 will see:
 *            a USB-serial adapter, an FTDI+optocoupler DIN input, or a game
 *            port cable off a DOS machine's MPU-401.
 *   fifo     a named pipe or stdin, for amidi/aseqdump/DOSBox/anything that
 *            can write raw MIDI bytes to a file descriptor.
 *   seq      ALSA sequencer (Linux) or CoreMIDI (macOS): a virtual input port
 *            that a keyboard or a DAW can be routed to.
 *   smf      a Standard MIDI File, played out against the clock, for
 *            unattended runs.
 *   raw      a file of raw MIDI bytes, pulled on the render thread. Unpaced it
 *            is bit-for-bit reproducible, which is what the cross-
 *            implementation conformance run needs; paced it is a wire.
 *
 * Every source converts to the same thing: bytes with arrival timestamps,
 * pushed into one FIFO, parsed by port/src/mtp_midi_parser.c exactly as on the
 * target. No source gets a shortcut into the synth.
