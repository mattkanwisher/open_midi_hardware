/* desktop_status.h - the honest runtime readout.
 *
 * Four things this build has that neither port/host nor the T113 has: a real
 * clock, a real sound card pulling at it, a terminal, and nothing else to do.
 * So it reports, continuously, the numbers that decide whether the design
 * works: underruns, ring occupancy, MIDI parse errors, and a real-time factor.
 *
 * ABOUT THE REAL-TIME FACTOR. It is measured on whatever machine you are
 * sitting at. docs/PLAN.md section 0 gates the whole project on an RTF of 0.5
 * to 0.6 on one Cortex-A7 at 1.2 GHz, and this number is not that number and
 * cannot be converted into it: different ISA, different cache, different memory
 * system, a PCM ROM that fits in an x86 L2 and will not fit in the A7's. Every
 * string this file prints says so, because a number printed next to the word
 * "real-time factor" will otherwise be quoted as if it were the gate.
