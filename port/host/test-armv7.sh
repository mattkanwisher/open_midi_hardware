# Cross-builds for Cortex-A7 (hard float, NEON) and runs the same test.sh
# through qemu-user. This catches alignment, type-size and endianness bugs in
# the parser, ring and render loop long before any silicon exists.
#
# What it does NOT tell you: anything about speed. QEMU's TCG does not model
# the A7 pipeline or its caches, so timings from it are meaningless and the
# real-time-factor gate in ../../bench cannot be closed this way.

# Needs: gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf, qemu-user.
