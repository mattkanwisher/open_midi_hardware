/* mtp_audio.h - the audio sink.
 *
 * Model: the platform owns a ring of fixed-size blocks that an I2S DMA engine
 * plays back to back, for ever. The application acquires the next free block,
 * fills it with interleaved stereo int16, and commits it. It never memcpys and
 * it never blocks inside the driver.
 *
 * The whole interface is five calls plus two counters. Everything harder --
 * sample rate conversion, mixing, volume -- is the application's problem,
 * on purpose: see PORTING.md, "Sample rate: why 48 kHz is free".
 *
 * Threading: acquire/commit are called from exactly one context (the render
 * loop). The DMA completion interrupt only advances the play cursor. That is
 * a single-producer/single-consumer ring and the implementation is responsible
 * for the barriers.

 * countdown reloaded at the moment the previous one fired.
 *
 * Why it matters: with an absolute sequence, a dropout costs exactly the blocks
 * that were missed and the stream resynchronises -- measured in emu/, recovery
 * is one sink period, always, with no drift. A countdown-based driver instead
 * pushes every subsequent deadline later by however long the interrupt was
 * delayed, so each dropout permanently slows the audio clock. The audio goes
 * flat, and -- worst of all -- mtp_audio_underruns() keeps reporting 0, because
 * from the ring's point of view nothing was ever missed.
