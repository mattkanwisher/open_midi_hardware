/* mtp_midi.h - the MIDI source.
 *
 * Deliberately a *byte* source, not a message source. The UART interrupt does
 * the minimum defensible work -- stamp the byte and drop it in a FIFO -- and
 * all the interpretation (running status, sysex reassembly, the 0xF7 that
 * never arrives) lives in portable code in src/mtp_midi_parser.c, where it can
 * be unit-tested on a laptop. See PORTING.md, "The MIDI path".
 *
 * Each byte carries its own arrival timestamp because at 31250 baud a byte
 * takes 320 us, which is longer than an audio block: knowing when a byte
 * arrived is the difference between a chord and an arpeggio.
